# ZigRayTracer

This is a ray tracer made in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) using [raylib-zig](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig). It was made following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://misterdanb.github.io/raytracinginrust/).

Images like these are the result:

The above picture was rendered using 400 samples per pixel and 40 max depth.

I made this project to learn more about both ray tracers, Zig, and raylib.
